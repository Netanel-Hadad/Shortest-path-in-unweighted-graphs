# Shortest-path-in-unweighted-graphs
Create an unweighted graph, select a vertex and see the graph's shortest path tree with the selected vertex as its source.

## Installation
* Clone the project repository or download the source code
* Install (or make sure you have):

  ```
  pip install pygame
  pip install tkinter
  ```
  
* Run main.py

## Features:
* Create vertecies on the screen.
* Connect them with edges.
* Run shortest path algorithm to see a vertex shortest paths tree.
* Save and load your graphs.

## Usage
* Double left-click to create a new vertex.
* Right click on two vertecies to create an edge between them.
* Middle mouse-click on a vertex to run the algorithm, making selected vertex the source.
* Press W-A-S-D to move the screen around.
* Right clicking on a selcted vertex will unselect it.
