# Shortest-path-in-unwieghted-graphs
Create an unweighted graph, select a vertex and see the graph's shortest path tree with the selected vertex as its source.

## Installation
* Clone the project repository or download the source code
* Install (or make sure you have):

  ```
  pip install pygame
  ```
  
* Run main.py

## Usage
* Double left-click to create a new vertex.
* Right click on two vertecies to create an edge between them.
* Middle mouse-click on a vertex to run the algorithm, making selected vertex the source.
* Press R to remove all vertecies and edges.
